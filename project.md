## 🌐 Stage 7: Website Integration & PWA

### Objectives
- Create customer-facing e-commerce website alongside POS system
- Implement device-responsive architecture with PWA support
- Optimize for 50k monthly users with minimal egress consumption

### Dual System Architecture
**POS System (Admin/Staff)**
- Real-time features for operational efficiency
- Advanced functionality for small user base
- Current implementation using App Router

**Website (Customer-Facing)**
- Optimistic UI without real-time subscriptions
- Device-responsive components (Desktop/Tablet/Mobile)
- PWA support for mobile app-like experience

### Technical Implementation

#### Device Detection & Routing
- **Server-side detection**: User-Agent parsing in getServerSideProps
- **Component mapping**:
  ```
  Desktop  → DesktopHome component
  Tablet   → TabletHome component  
  Mobile   → MobileHome component
  ```
- **Pages Router**: Separate from admin App Router system

#### Data Strategy
- **Minimal fetching**: Only essential user data (name, email, cart)
- **Optimistic updates**: Instant UI feedback via useState/Context
- **No real-time**: Memory-only state management
- **Egress optimization**: Selective queries, efficient caching

#### PWA Configuration
- **Manifest file**: App metadata, icons, theme colors
- **Service Worker**: Offline caching, background sync
- **Installable**: Add to homescreen functionality
- **Cross-device**: Responsive design for all screen sizes
